# Halcyonite Tweaks

A mod that tweaks the Halcyonite enemies to be more fair, pretty much an updated version of the old HalcyoniteFixes mod by Nuxlar. Fixes currently include:

- Making Halcyonites properly handle freeze/stun.
- Making the golden swipe/thrust attacks require line of sight to be used and reducing distance required to activate them.

## TODO:
The mod is not finished yet. I just wanted to get some priority fixes out first, so here is the rest of what I have planned:

- Adjust hitboxes potentially, both size and when they come out
- Add a gap between skill uses to prevent animation cancelling
- Make Halcyonite skil usage a bit more fair in Eclipse 7
- Adjusting the speed of the whirlwind attack
- Potentially damage/knockback changes

## Credits
- Moffein for the freeze/stun fix. His RiskyTweaks mod does the same thing, so the fix here just gets disabled if that fix is enabled on that mod.
- Nuxlar, for his Halcyonite Fixes mod that is now deprecated. A lot of the ideas from this mod come from that, and I got permission from him to update his HalcyoniteFixes mod code to work with the newer SOTS versions!
